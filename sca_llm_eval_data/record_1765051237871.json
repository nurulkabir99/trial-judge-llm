All five matches are to files written in Python or C (numpy's mingw32ccompiler.py, samba's symbols.py, zlib's untgz.c, busybox's ln.c, and numpy's crackfortran.py). The similarity scores range from 0.75 to 0.77, which falls into the moderate similarity band, but no fingerprint (file_fp or chunk_fp) matches any of the user snippet, indicating no direct copy of identical chunks. The overlapping terms (e.g., \"set\", \"if\", \"file\", \"copy\") are common across many build\u2011system scripts and source files, and the languages differ, so the resemblance is likely due to generic programming constructs rather than substantive code reuse. Consequently the snippet appears to be independently authored.\n\nRegarding licenses, the matched files carry a mix of permissive (BSD\u20113\u2011Clause, Zlib) and strong copyleft (GPL\u20112.0-only, GPL\u20113.0-or-later) licenses. Because there is no evidence of copying, these licenses do not impose any obligations on the CMake script. Therefore the overall license risk is \"none\".\n\nIn summary, while the vector similarity engine flagged moderate scores, the lack of identical fingerprints and the disparity in language and purpose lead to a low\u2011risk assessment with an \"independent\" infringement basis and no license conflict.",
